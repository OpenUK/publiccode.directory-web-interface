# Public Code Directory

## Where Open Source Software is curated



After seeking contributions to an OpenUK NHS report project, it became apparent that there is lots of Public Administration Open Source being created but no curated list of applications, meaning that lots of local builds are taking place.

This project aims to enable a single directory segmented in to categories, then indexes of Public code and projects.


#### What problem does this solve?


- 'Discoverability' of Public Code - find out what has been written, who made it and how to get it
- Repo owners manage the description via their normal code repo
- A visitor can discover mature software rather than trawling through thousands of repositories

#### Who is behind it?

This is an OpenUK initiative in association with the EU Free Software Policy group to provide a practical tool to support the PMPC campaign.

#### Operations

A repo needs to be registered in the database and have meta data within the repo to be included. The index will build the rest on the fly. The full details of the database can be found in the database folder and here is a summary.

#### Sector categories


Repositories of public code belong to a set of categories, therefore each have a separate index. For example, these may indicate:

* Local administration
* Central government / national
* Healthcare
* Education
* Defence

A repo may exist in multiple categories if it happened to originate in one of these yet be relevant to more than one. A tag is used to indicate the categories that an entry belongs to.

#### Maintainer category

Code is created and maintained by various organisations, either public, NGO or commercial.

#### Getting involved


There are a few ways you can get involved.

##### Technical Git users:

* Get the database file
* Add your entries
* Add your metadata files to your repo
* Make a pull request on the database
* When accepted, you should see your entry in the directory

##### Non-technical git users


Raise a Github issue with your comments or inclusions
